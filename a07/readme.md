# #7: High Fidelity Prototype
Diana Alamari, DH110: User Experience and Design


## Introduction
The purpose of my project is to provide a space for music enthusiasts to be able to fulfull all their music and film needs in Hawaii. Residents and visitors alike will benefit from the app. The app presents a comprehensive approach to finding events, social activities, and career/creative studio resources, all in one spot. Users are able to upload upcoming events that they have organized or those organized by others. This allows users of the app to be given as much resources as possible; in other words, user-uploaded activities gives users extra events/resources to explore, instead of sticking to only tourist/generic activities that are already online/able to be found with just a google search away.


## Tasks + Prototype

The two tasks that the high-fidelity prototype supports (will fully support in the next few days as the project finishes up) are listed:
- Task 1: Finding an event via filter
  - Users are able to search under one of two divisions: music and film, to find a related event. In this prototype, users are able to find a community-uploaded concert. 
- Task 2: Messaging a user (the event uploader/organizer)
  - After finding the event (concert), users are able to message the person who posted the event.

## Findings and Notes
### Cognitive Walkthrough:

I made some changes from the low-fidelity prototype that changed not only the look of the prototype, but some functions as well. I had one participant follow visually through the wireflow, until the prototype is completely finished. They found the transition to mostly be easier than the participant who had evaluated. The part that stood out to him as confusing is the selected concert page, where it shows the poster. He was confused in navigating out of the app to get tickets, and in messaging the poster. Because of this, I added a message button underneath the poster's picture on that page to add some clarity.

### Additional Notes:

The ability to click back, along with some other intended functions, still needs to be made interactive. The high-fidelity prototype will see much more improvement before the next assignment.
