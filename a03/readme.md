#3 Contextual Inquiry (User Research)
Diana Alamari | Digital Humanities 110 | User Experience and Design | Fall 2021


The user research approach collects information on what resources are most significant to creatives/enthusiasts, as well as how they would look for them. I spoke with people in the entertainment industry as well as regular music fans and collected the following main takeaways:

Concerts, festivals, and social events are among the general interests that consumers sought to discover.
Workshops, creative studios, and career-oriented resources are all things that creatives seek. They want those to: improve upon their vocal, instrument, filming, or producing skills; surround themselves with fellow creatives for networking or friends; search/train for a job that is the right fit for their creative needs.
To use/possibly continue using the site, all users must have significant engagement with it. To do so, people must be able to swiftly and easily locate what they are looking for (a concert, the most recent general entertainment events, low-cost recording studios, film production workshops, etc.).
