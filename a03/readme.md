# #3 Contextual Inquiry (User Research)
Diana Alamari | Digital Humanities 110 | User Experience and Design | Fall 2021


The user research approach collects information on what resources are most significant to creatives/enthusiasts, as well as how they would look for them. The *challenges* in designing the app's concept lie in the multiple ideas I have for implementing beneficial features of the app. Transferring concepts into actual interactive app features will be more difficult because of this. I want to make sure that target users will benefit from efficient Hawaii resources implemented into the app, but I also want the interface to be simple. With *contextual inquiry* as a one research/data collection method, I will be able to see what key features are valuable by actual prospective target users, in order to narrow down ideas for the app's features. 


I interviewed a *target user* participant in order to evaluate their interests/relevance to my Hawaii creative resource app's concept. The user was selected based on their background in creative departments included in my app, and questions were designed to gather data that will support key concept features of the app. I then had them perform two main tasks that may be useful for the app:











<details>
 <summary> 1. Research music events such as concerts or festivals that are in Hawaii. </summary>
    
>  - Can you go on Google or whatever method you would use to do this?
>  - Can you select a concert, possibly one that you might be interested in?
>  - Do you like the layout of the page? The filter, sort, and other options to narrow search?
    </details>

  <summary> 2. Can you research any website for music learning resources, or career resource related to music? </summary>
    
>  - Can you research any website for music learning resources, or career resource related to music? Either or.
>  - Do you like the layout and method of navigating?
>  - What possible recommendations would you give to improve your search?

## Observations 

As I spoke with people with music backgrounds, I collected the following main takeaways:

- Concerts, festivals, and social events are among the general interests that consumers sought to discover.
- Workshops, creative studios, and career-oriented resources are all things that creatives seek. They want those to: improve upon their vocal, instrument, filming, or producing skills; surround themselves with fellow creatives for networking or friends; search/train for a job that is the right fit for their creative needs.
- To use/possibly continue using the site, all users must have significant engagement with it. To do so, people must be able to swiftly and easily locate what they are looking for (a concert, the most recent general entertainment events, low-cost recording studios, film production workshops, etc.).

The particular participant interviewed above loved the idea about a comprehensive resource app that anyone could upload. 

The context in his case is:
- He has been in bands and performed since around the 1st grade. 
- He knows multiple instruments but has committed to drums since then. 
- He is advanced in playing drums.
- He is  traveling to Hawaii in December 2021. 

He described the struggle of finding rehearsal studios and other music resources in new locations, and wants to be able to do so when he travels. 

Because of this, he *particularly* fit perfectly into my project (down to the part where he is actually going to Hawaii soon).

As a musician, he mentioned that it would be valuable to find niche activities, practice studios, and other resources that are somewhat difficult to find with a quick Google search. He endorsed this app's solutions for taking care of that through user/community uploads, community discussions, and filtering options.


## Reflection

This research process was very interesting, and I was very satisfied with the plethora of information provided by the main participant I interviewed (from the video posted on here.) The participant specifically has professional music background and is even travelling to Hawaii during the holidays in December 2021. Additionally, he jumped ahead to questions I was going to ask, and gave thoughtful, additional input without me even asking. My participant selection was very efficient in this regard, because it allowed me to thoroughly understand what an actual musician/likely user interested in Hawaii would want to see in an app. 

I do think I could have articulated a bit better verbally, but otherwise, the key interview questions allowed me to gather valuable information for conceptualizing the app prototype. This video will be fantastic for reference in future app improvements, as well.
