# Interface Design
Diana Alamari | Digital Humanities 110 | Fall 2021

## Introduction

The purpose of my project is to provide music and film enthusiasts visiting/residing in Hawaii the ability to use one app for all their creative needs within Hawaii. They will be able to search for various creative events or resource they want, such as concerts, workshops, and recording studios. This interface design's purpose is to digitalize the low-fidelity prototypes, and create a common theme after exploring design variations. For design consideration, I referred to Hawaii Creative Industry's website, Google Fonts, Yelp, and Meetup. I digitalized the wireframes on Figma with the iPhone 11-sized wireframes.
