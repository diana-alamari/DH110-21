# Creative Industry Resources: Visitors and Residents of Hawaii 
## Diana Alamari

### Introduction: 
What is the project about? The motivation of the project and possible contribution.

The high-fidelity prototype I created is an event and resource app for creatives that are traveling or residing in Hawaii. I based my work off of the Hawaii Creative Industries Division (CID) website and utilized user experience processes to both improve upon parts of the site, as well as create a new derivative app that creatives would like. I was motivated to create a high-fidelity prototype after getting an understanding of user interests and evaluation through the steps mentioned below. 


### Clear design statement: 
What is the issue and Why do you think it is important to resolve that issue by your project?

The Hawaii CID site lacks user accesibilty and relevant, working resources for creatives interested in Hawaii. Google SEO may pop up with lots of well-established recurring events in Hawaii, but there should always be ways to improve accessibility and tailor search results. 

There are tons of events that are not accessible through quick Google searches, especially events related to niche interests. 
The goal of this project is to create a highly-accessible app that serves as a comprehensive hub for music and film resources. Users will be able to upload events and discuss them on the community section of the app, also. 

By allowing users to upload events, this creates a surge in accessible resources and activities in which creatives can participate. People may want to host a workshop -- they can upload it on the app and gain traction. There might also be passionate people who urgently want to share with fellow fans their favorite music artist's concerts, album premiere events, or other activities they might do in Hawaii. The most passionate fans know and immediately want to find out what they are much before the media catches on; and if they like less-known artists, those artists may not even have much of a platform anywhere else at all. 

Users are able to message those who post events to find out more or chat about common interests. Related to that, the community section allows users to see what other creatives are saying about the latest entertainment events going on in the state. 

To create more universal accessibility, I made sure to include resources inclusive to all music and film enthusiasts -- not only those who work in entertainment/actively perform creative work. Concerts are one example in which any music enthusiast would be interested, which is what the high-fidelity prototype demonstrates with clickable interaction.

Hawaii has a broad range of government websites for their divisions. The intent of each division's website is to provide informative content from which the website user can benefit. Some divisions of Hawaii's government contain more flaws than others. It is crucial to determine what flaws are present to improve usability. For this reason, I am going to evaluate usability conditions of two Hawaii website divisions: Hawaii's Creative Industries and Hawaii State Department of Health . I selected these two very different divisions because of my interest in those division topics and their presentation through their websites. By selecting two very different websites for heuristic evaluation, I was able to obtain broader context on their strengths and weaknesses.

The heuristic evaluation performed allowed me to determine which website I am interested in improving: The Creative Industries website. Gathering usability problems among each website will serve as a foundation off of which I will present an improved website design of the Creative Industries division for the Hawaii website.

By conducting usability testing, I was able to see an outsider's perspective on the level of usability functions on the Hawaii CID site. I had a participant perform three tasks related to weaknesses and strengths found through the heuristic evaluation. The areas of weakness on the site were illuminated as I had the user perform each task, which you can find below.

### User research [contextual inquiry, assignment04]:
Summary and link to your assignment folder

The user research process gathers valuable input on what resources are most important to creatives/enthusiasts, and how they would search for it. I have spoken to those working in entertainment as well as general music enthusiasts and gathered some key takeaways: 
1. **General interests that users wanted to find** include attending concerts, festivals, and social activities.
2. **Creatives want the above as well as workshops, creative studios, and career-oriented resources**. They want those to: improve upon their vocal, instrument, filming, or producing skills; surround themselves with fellow creatives for networking or friends; search/train for a job that is the right fit for their creative needs. 
3. **All users need meaningful interaction with the site to use it/possibly keep using it**. To do that, they need to be able to find what they want (a concert, latest general entertainment events, cheap recording studios, film production workshops...) quickly and with ease.

Based off this, I was able to get a foundational understanding of app features that entertainment enthusiasts would want to use.

### UX storytelling [persona+scenario, assignment05]
Summary and link to your assignment folder


By determining conceptually useful app features through the previous UX steps, I translated them into creating user personas that may use those features.

I created two personas of potential app users: Eilana and Leo, both of which are introduced below.

### Wireframe and graphic design element variation [assignment06 + part of 07]

After investigating user personas, the app's concept was cemented for the low-fidelity prototype to be built.
