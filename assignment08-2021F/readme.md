Hawaii has a broad range of government websites for their divisions. The intent of each division's website is to provide informative content from which the website user can benefit. Some divisions of Hawaii's government contain more flaws than others. It is crucial to determine what flaws are present to improve usability. For this reason, I am going to evaluate usability conditions of two Hawaii website divisions: Hawaii's Creative Industries and Hawaii State Department of Health . I selected these two very different divisions because of my interest in those division topics and their presentation through their websites. By selecting two very different websites for heuristic evaluation, I was able to obtain broader context on their strengths and weaknesses.

The heuristic evaluation performed allowed me to determine which website I am interested in improving: The Creative Industries website. Gathering usability problems among each website will serve as a foundation off of which I will present an improved website design of the Creative Industries division for the Hawaii website.
