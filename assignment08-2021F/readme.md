# Creative Industry Resources: Visitors and Residents of Hawaii 
## Diana Alamari

### Introduction: 
What is the project about? The motivation of the project and possible contribution.

The high-fidelity prototype I created is an event and resource app for creatives that are traveling or residing in Hawaii. I based my work off of the Hawaii Creative Industries Division (CID) website and utilized user experience processes to both improve upon parts of the site, as well as create a new derivative app that creatives would like. I was motivated to create a high-fidelity prototype after getting an understanding of user interests and evaluation through the steps mentioned below. 


### Clear design statement: 
What is the issue and Why do you think it is important to resolve that issue by your project?

The Hawaii CID site lacks user accesibilty and relevant, working resources for creatives interested in Hawaii. Google SEO may pop up with lots of well-established recurring events in Hawaii, but there should always be ways to improve accessibility and tailor search results. 

There are tons of events that are not accessible through quick Google searches, especially events related to niche interests. 
The goal of this project is to create a highly-accessible app that serves as a comprehensive hub for music and film resources. Users will be able to upload events and discuss them on the community section of the app, also. 

By allowing users to upload events, this creates a surge in accessible resources and activities in which creatives can participate. People may want to host a workshop -- they can upload it on the app and gain traction. There might also be passionate people who urgently want to share with fellow fans their favorite music artist's concerts, album premiere events, or other activities they might do in Hawaii. The most passionate fans know and immediately want to find out what they are much before the media catches on; and if they like less-known artists, those artists may not even have much of a platform anywhere else at all. 

Users are able to message those who post events to find out more or chat about common interests. Related to that, the community section allows users to see what other creatives are saying about the latest entertainment events going on in the state. 

To create more universal accessibility, I made sure to include resources inclusive to all music and film enthusiasts -- not only those who work in entertainment/actively perform creative work. Concerts are one example in which any music enthusiast would be interested, which is what the high-fidelity prototype demonstrates with clickable interaction.

Hawaii has a broad range of government websites for their divisions. The intent of each division's website is to provide informative content from which the website user can benefit. Some divisions of Hawaii's government contain more flaws than others. It is crucial to determine what flaws are present to improve usability. For this reason, I am going to evaluate usability conditions of two Hawaii website divisions: Hawaii's Creative Industries and Hawaii State Department of Health . I selected these two very different divisions because of my interest in those division topics and their presentation through their websites. By selecting two very different websites for heuristic evaluation, I was able to obtain broader context on their strengths and weaknesses.

The heuristic evaluation performed allowed me to determine which website I am interested in improving: The Creative Industries website. Gathering usability problems among each website will serve as a foundation off of which I will present an improved website design of the Creative Industries division for the Hawaii website.

By conducting usability testing, I was able to see an outsider's perspective on the level of usability functions on the Hawaii CID site. I had a participant perform three tasks related to weaknesses and strengths found through the heuristic evaluation. 

The tasks included:
- Searching for a music event
- Finding a resource with details on filming in Hawaii
- Searching for industry economic performance

The areas of weakness on the site were illuminated as I had the user perform each task, which you can find below.

### User research [contextual inquiry, assignment04]:
Summary and link to your assignment folder

The user research process gathers valuable input on what resources are most important to creatives/enthusiasts, and how they would search for it. I have spoken to those working in entertainment as well as general music enthusiasts and gathered some key takeaways: 
1. **General interests that users wanted to find** include attending concerts, festivals, and social activities.
2. **Creatives want the above as well as workshops, creative studios, and career-oriented resources**. They want those to: improve upon their vocal, instrument, filming, or producing skills; surround themselves with fellow creatives for networking or friends; search/train for a job that is the right fit for their creative needs. 
3. **All users need meaningful interaction with the site to use it/possibly keep using it**. To do that, they need to be able to find what they want (a concert, latest general entertainment events, cheap recording studios, film production workshops...) quickly and with ease.

[More on the contextual inquiry](https://github.com/diana-alamari/DH110-21/blob/main/a03/readme.md)

Based off this, I was able to get a foundational understanding of related app features that entertainment enthusiasts would want to use.

### UX storytelling 

By determining conceptually useful app features through the previous UX steps, I translated them into creating user personas that may use those features.
Empathizing and envisioning potential users of my app through UX storytelling is highly valuable, as it allowed me to put myself in a hypothetical user's shoes to explore how they would use my app to accomplish their desired creative goals. The process stressed key elements in what steps they would need to take to accomplish said goal. 

For example, as I developed the personas, I found that it was important to address broader target user interests such as concerts, the navigation steps that targer users would take to get to the concert event page, and how key elements of their persona will be utilized in the app, such as their desire to message someone due to their social interests.

I created two personas of potential app users: Eilana and Leo, both of which are introduced below.

### Low-fidelity prototype 
Summary and link to the sketches (may contains the multiple versions and evaluation history)

With the wireflow done, The app's concept features has been cemented for the low-fidelity prototype to be built. The wireflow demonstrates how the interactive tasks will be conducted. 

The interactive tasks are:

1. Find a (concert) event uploaded by a user of the app.
2. View uploader's profile and message her.

Bonus mini-tasks:
- Pop-up the main menu to head back home
- Message the uploader directly from her event post (clicking "message under her profile picture)

### Wireframes and graphic design  

Based on the user personas and feedback from a participant and the low fidelity prototype, I created low-fi wireflow. Then, I transferred those into digital design to prepare for the high-fidelity interactive prototype.

I first started exploring design variations on just one wireframe. I created design variations as it relates to color, shape, and typographic content.
The wireframes provided a basic layout of how the app looks and more importantly, what features will be included for target users (creatives traveling to or residing in Hawaii). 

I ended up pursing the following design:

![Wireflow](https://github.com/diana-alamari/DH110-21/blob/main/a07/wireflow%20a7%20.png?raw=true)

Based off feedback and the last pursued design, I applied the same theme to implement into completed wireframes that will be used for the high-fidelity prototype:

After trial-and-error through the low-fi prototype as well as a participant's testing, I made various key changes, including the clarity of words written in buttons, so that users can understand exactly where they will be redirected to. Of course, testing and design is meant upon which to be built, so that the app is more user-friendly, and aesthetically pleasing. Building the high-fi prototype to be interactive was a lengthy but rewarding process -- you get to see how your visioned app comes to life.

## Evaluation and Revision History 
Including cognitive walkthrough; impression test, accessibility audit, usability testing), per each summary and link to the notes (when you share the video or other detailed evidences, I will notify you when you can make the contents private as soon as your work is graded)

After the high-fidelity prototype was created, I had a couple of users evaluate it. This allowed me to spend more time noticing areas of improvement from both their perspective as well as my own (considering I am looking at the prototype along with them, and their ideas stimulate further ideas of my own.)

### Conclusion

Throughout the project's process, I was extremely satisfied with the amount of UX knowledge gained.  Building upon an app that people can use for music and film resources is something that I personally would love to utilize. The ability to implement essential component of UX/UI with creatives in the industry through my creative topic of interest has been truly invaluable. 


For future projects, I will improve upon some steps that could have been further developed here. Due to a time-related conflict along with a fairly short timeframe, I was limited in my ability to strengthen some elements more. 

A couple of things I will develop in future projects: 
I would love to have created wireframes to prototype the community section of the app, since that is a large conceptual section in itself. Although I did utilize some of the following, I would have loved to invest further in subtle design effects that make a big difference in appearance -- such as creating linear gradients on each page, and uniform drop shadows among various buttons. I also would have conducted mini steps of the whole process repeatedly to significantly strengthen the high-fidelity prototype. This includes further usability testing with my own app, participant feedback, developing more personas accordingly, and even aesthetically improving how I'd present their profiles and journey. 

Fortunately, I was able to focus instead on building foundational knowledge of how all the steps tie together, and demonstrate that understanding. There is definitely more envisioned than implemented. I can and will always strive to improve upon each section for future UX work -- I already have design (Photoshop as a hobby) and analytic research experience (college and current analyst job), so the UX process as a whole is most valuable to cement in my mind. 

I aimed to conceptually address all the steps I would take to deliver the creative app I envisioned. From competitor analysis and user research to user storytelling and design, all areas are essential for a UX designer to have under their belt. I am happy that I gained such comprehensive UX skills and insight so quickly.
