As I went through the user research process with the Hawaii Industries website, I was able to evaluate problems amongst users that I would like to address. Particular weaknesses revolve around the lack of useful creative resources and clear contextual information. In other words, problems include

1. Resource links that were provided were outdated or nonfunctioning
2. Resource links were not relevant to what the average creative interested in Hawaii activities would want
3. Resource links provided under the "music" page and resource page lacked contextual information/detail, leading users to not know what they would be clicking.

For further clarification on number two: I received input and made inferences through heuristic evaluation and participant observation/input; however, I had to execute my findings. To do this, I further explored what the average creative might want later into the process with *user personas*. (link)

With the personas I created, I was able to figure out what the typical user of the app might look like; at a basic level the typical user might be technically savy, with social inclinations and a desire to do their (creative) interests particularly in Hawaii. The behavioral pattern to be addressed is a user with that profile being unable to find a website that clearly contains constantly-updated activities to fulfill their interests.

Considering all of the above, my solution for the typical user is to create an app that presents trending and browseable activities with a community component. 

The two main tasks that will ultimately be prototyped are:
1. The ability to search for a creative event relevant to the user's interests
2. The ability to make contact with others.
