# 5: Low-Fidelity Prototype
Diana Alamari | Digital Humanities 110 | User Experience and Design | Fall 2021

## Introduction
As I went through the user research process with the Hawaii Industries website, I was able to evaluate problems amongst users that I would like to address. Particular weaknesses revolve around the lack of useful creative resources and clear contextual information. In particular, problems include:

1. Resource links that were provided were outdated or nonfunctioning
2. Resource links were not relevant to what the average creative interested in Hawaii activities would want
3. Resource links provided under the "music" page and resource page lacked contextual information/detail, leading users to not know what they would be clicking.

### Purpose of Low-Fidelity Prototyping
**Persona**

To determine what the average user might want, I made inferences through heuristic evaluation and through input from participant observation. Then, I had to execute my findings into practical user scenarios. The personas I created allowed me to see what the typical user of the app might look like -- at a basic level, the typical user likely is technically savy, social, and creative. The behavioral pattern to be addressed is a user with that profile being unable to find a website that provides them with creative and social resources.

  Both personas are musicians who aspire to enter the music industry in the future.
  - Persona 1: Leo; Pop culture enthusiast/freelance music director who wants immediate access to new events
  - Persona 2: Eilana; Business analyst who wants to make a friend through an event

**From Persona to Low-Fidelity Prototype**
This process was foundational to start low-fidelity prototyping; I needed to comprehend a user's journey to provide me the ability to visualize desirable components of an app. Lo-fi prototyping allows designers to test and improve upon tentative functions proposed on an interface. My low-fidelity prototyping aims to address the typical user's problems by allowing them to find upcoming events through a community of people with common interests.

### Tasks
The two main tasks that will ultimately be prototyped are:
1. The ability to search for a creative event relevant to the user's interests 
2. The ability to contact others associated with that event.

## Wireframes & User Wireflow

*Task 1 is performed in rows 1 and 2 in the wireflow. Task 2 follows from row 2's last frame to the end of row 3.*

## Low-Fidelity Prototype Testing

I recruited a participant to test this prototype's features and bugs. The process is demonstrated below.

**Task 1**
*Rows 1 and 2*
The participant really wanted to search by typing at the top. I really considered making that interactive in my prototype, but I wanted to keep the upload filter selection included. 

Also, he was not what the filter and sort buttons meant, as they were not labelled. 
Lastly, the user mentioned that the "user-upload" filter selection was worded in a confusing manner. He suggested to consider "uploaded by user" or some other key phrase. 

**Task 2**

In comparison, the user had no problem at all with the message function -- proving to be a simpler task than the event search. This was expected, as it's a very short process with no filtering needed. The only lack of clarity revolved around how I instructed him to message the uploader. Otherwise, he figured to click on the uploader and message.

## Reflection

This entire process reflects the value of low-fidelity prototyping. Creating the prototype was the first step to implementing a visual app. Interface had to be strategically designed with extensive consideration of music enthusiasts traveling. I have had thorough visions of all the features the app could provide to address target user needs. These included upcoming Hawaii events such as concerts and music workshops; resources that an aspiring creative could use such as a music studio; and a large social component for creatives such as a community forum section. This broad idea made it harder to narrow down two tasks with which are important to start the prototyping process. The actual interface creation took longer than expected. Due to the wide range of conceptual features, I considered designing an advanced search or advanced filter, akin to that of Craigslist, but for simplicity reasons decided against it. This resulted in some difficulty with categorizing features and deciding what interactions that would execute the app's intended features.

The low-fidelity prototype testing brought attention to flawed design choices among the activiy search process.  I knew there were many directions that I could've taken with prototyping features; although, having a participant involved exacerbated unclear details with the direction I took in this prototype. His confusion among the "user-upload' selection was valuable to note. This showed me how that filter needs to clearly show what/why it's useful as a selection. Before deciding a name for it, I'll need to consider the context that leads a person to click it: examples of questions I visually need to address may include 'Why would people click it?' and 'How can I show them the benefits of events uploaded by community users?' These questions relate to developing a stronger emphasis on the social/community aspect of the app. 

A flaw in prioritizing the upload filter interaction over the search bar is that the search bar is much more intuitional, and the filter option is typically used only after key words are searched. 
I could have done one of two things: either stick to that one frame and not make 'user-upload' interactive (which hypothetically broadens the search results, but for simplicity the Paramore event would remain at the top); or keep that upload filter's frame but add an additional wireframe that excludes the upload filter. Alternatively, the user-upload option could just be ommitted as a filter option altogether. The unclear page menus contrasted in a beneficial way with the message function. The concept from clicking on an uploader to message them is not unusal, but had me thinking if it should be a priority task to prototype -- compared to messaging someone via the "Community" menu option at the bottom of the app. Aside from that, the actual messaging task was very straightforward in comparison to the activity filter. Its simplicity gave me insight on how smooth the interactions within the search functions should be. With all these considered, I gained more insight as to how to improve clarity of the prototype's functions.
