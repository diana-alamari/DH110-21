Hawaii's Creative Industries website contains brief overviews to creative divisions such as music and film, as well as their respective activities and resources.
However I have noticed some areas upon which the website could use some improvement for smoother user interaction. To further analyze a user's experience with the site, I will conduct usability testing through a pilot study, which will involve recruiting a participant for user feedback.

To further detail, the purpose of the Usability Testing is to gain outside perspectives of how a user feels when dealing with an interface. The purpose of a pilot study is to evaluate and fine-tune the feasiabilty of studies.
Recruiting a participant for a pilot study is fundamental to the user expereince process; this will allow me as a designer to initialize usability testing of an interface. By experimenting with an initial interface, designers are able to utilize the participant user's feedback to fine-tine logistics of the interface upon which they want to improve. 

Through this study, I am testing for the usability of the Creative Industries website. Some initial flaws I discovered through the heuristic evaluation were the lack of: 
- Relevant content for each division, 
- Accurate seach results, working resourcle links, and
- Relevant resource links with descriptions.

Particularly, the resource links as well as the search for relevant content stood out to me. As a result, I created my survey and oriented my pilot testing around these problems.

The pilot test consisted of three main tasks intended for participant completion:
1. Find upcoming music/theatre events in Hawaii.
> - Scenario: "...you are a musician that is interested in finding events in Maui. You want to find a functioning resource from the Creative Industry Hawaii site to find upcoming music/theatre events"
> - Tasks: Locate and click on a Theatre or Music resource link based in Maui, look for a "calendar" or "events" section, find an up-to-date 2021 or 2022 event  
2. Find information and tips on filming in Hawaii.
> - Scenario: "...you work in the Film industry and want to find information on how to get started in Hawaii. You want to follow the Creative Film Industry's Film Office tips"
> - Tasks: Locate Film page, locate where the Film Office resource is to be redirected, find a page with the information needed for filming in the state
3. Find information on the economic performance of creative employment within Hawaii.
> - Scenario: "...you are interested in a career in the Creative Industry. You like Hawaii and want to look for information on how the industry employment is economically performing before deciding if you should move there for a career"
> - Tasks: Search for creative job performance, locate a link with job growth rate, find out percentage and the time period of the finding 

Each task was created with the intention of envisioning a creative that wants to find useful relevant information to their creative area of interest. 

Each task was designed to address the heuristic evaluation flaws in action, through participant testing. 
- Task 1 aims to observe the ease in finding a resource that provides the user with creative activities/events. Anyone with a love for creative activities may want to find straightforward methods to participate in events when in Hawaii.
- Task 2 represents the ease in finding resourceful content for a creative beginning their work in Hawaii. A creative may want this to gain foundational knowledge, in order to get a headstart working in the state.
- Task 3 represents the desire to find creative industry statistics in Hawaii. A creative may use this to consider conducting work in the state.

The pilot test revealed a couple ----.
Task 1 took the longest to complete, as I expected. Creatives may need to access 



It is worth considering the participant's behavior and persona into this pilot. The participant did not appear to show or express strong feelings throughout the testing. Within this context, emphasis should be further placed on other measures of evaluating usability.

Attempts were made to gather flaws from the participant, but she did not express many.
