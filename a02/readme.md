Hawaii's Creative Industries website contains brief overviews to creative divisions such as music and film, as well as their respective activities and resources. There is also a separate page that lists resource links per division. However I have noticed some areas upon which the website could use some improvement for smoother user interaction. To further analyze a user's experience with the site, I will conduct usability testing through a pilot study, which will involve recruiting a participant for user feedback.

To further detail, the purpose of the Usability Testing is to gain outside perspectives of how a user feels when dealing with an interface. The purpose of a pilot study is to evaluate and fine-tune the feasiabilty of studies.
Recruiting a participant for a pilot study is fundamental to the user expereince process; this will allow me as a designer to initialize usability testing of an interface. By experimenting with an initial interface, designers are able to utilize the participant user's feedback to fine-tine logistics of the interface upon which they want to improve. 

Through this study, I am testing for the usability of the Creative Industries website. Some initial flaws I discovered through the heuristic evaluation were the lack of: 
- Relevant content for each division, 
- Accurate seach results, working resourcle links, and
- Relevant resource links with descriptions.

Particularly, the resource links as well as the search for relevant content stood out to me. As a result, I created my survey and oriented my pilot testing around these problems.

The pilot test consisted of three main tasks intended for participant completion:
1. Find upcoming music/theatre events in Hawaii.
> - Scenario: "...you are a musician that is interested in finding events in Maui. You want to find a functioning resource from the Creative Industry Hawaii site to find upcoming music/theatre events"
> - Tasks: Locate and click on a Theatre or Music resource link based in Maui, look for a "calendar" or "events" section, find an up-to-date 2021 or 2022 event  
2. Find information and tips on filming in Hawaii.
> - Scenario: "...you work in the Film industry and want to find information on how to get started in Hawaii. You want to follow the Creative Film Industry's Film Office tips"
> - Tasks: Locate Film page, locate where the Film Office resource is to be redirected, find a page with the information needed for filming in the state
3. Find information on the economic performance of creative employment within Hawaii.
> - Scenario: "...you are interested in a career in the Creative Industry. You like Hawaii and want to look for information on how the industry employment is economically performing before deciding if you should move there for a career"
> - Tasks: Search for creative job performance, locate a link with job growth rate, find out percentage and the time period of the finding 

Each task was created with the intention of envisioning a creative that wants to find useful relevant information to their creative area of interest. 

Each task was designed to address the heuristic evaluation flaws in action, through participant testing. 
- Task 1 aims to observe the ease in finding a resource that provides the user with creative activities/events. Anyone with a love for creative activities may want to find straightforward methods to participate in events when in Hawaii.
- Task 2 represents the ease in finding resourceful content for a creative beginning their work in Hawaii. A creative may want this to gain foundational knowledge, in order to get a headstart working in the state.
- Task 3 represents the desire to find creative industry statistics in Hawaii. A creative may use this to consider conducting work in the state.

### UT Findings + Future UT Improvements
#### Learning from Task Observations
The pilot test revealed useful information in addressing flaws for future improvement.
Task 1 took the longest to complete, as I expected. This task was created because I acknowledged the broad appeal for finding activities, and knew that the usability problem was severe. By observing the participant, I noticed that she struggled with finding a link to begin with. Because the resource link had no details, she had to click on each to see if it was a relevant link. Then she had to see if the link even contained an event page. There was no clear detail where the clickable resource link was. even about so she could know if it is appropriate to click. 
There were no filter options for the resources too, making the resource with activities harder to find also.

Task 2 and task 3 were shorter as expect also. These were performed with more ease than the first task. Task 2 was created with the intention of seeing how clear the presentation of important resources on the Film page was. The participant struggled with finding a clearly-presented "Film Office" resource, but appeared and described the task as relatively easy. Task 3 aimed to address the search relevance flaws in finding data needed. The user questionned which search result was relevant, but expressed that it was comparatively straightforward.

#### Post-Questionnaire User Feedback
Attempts were made to gather flaws from the participant, but she did not express many. On her questionnaire, she consistently addressed questions with above-average positive responses.

However, it is worth considering the participant's behavior and persona into this pilot. The participant did not verbally express struggles throughout the testing, and this was not reflected in the post-test questionnaire. 

Within this context, emphasis should be further placed on other measures of evaluating usability. One method is to analyze body language and expressions during the testing. Another method is to come up with questions that gently probe useful information out of them.

I used the second method by asking for recommendations on improving the website. This makes the user think creative manner. This also pushes the user to identify flaws. 

As I asked improvement questions, that is when I found out the participant's difficulties from her perspective. The user expressed difficulty in the length of links, proportionate to the lack of details for each. She mentioned that there are too many links, but no details on any of them whatsoever. Furthermore, she pointed out the problem of links being dysfunctional and not up-to-date. 

#### User participant recommendations

Her recommendations were to:
- Reduce the resource page's links, and add details for each link instead, in order to determine if the website is worth clicking on.
- Ensure that links work.
- Make creative division pages easier to navigate; in other words, make resource links clearer, and organize the page content.

#### Future UT Improvements

It is worth discussing flaws upon which I can improve in future testing.

Due to the previous person being unable to participate, I used a personal connection as a participant. This can create some bias in interpreting results; as a result, observations can easier to observe if the personality is totally known. That also decreased the professionalism of how the interview was conducted.   
A solution to gaining more participant insight is to create more pre- and post-testing questions that address the person's technical experience, as well as their personality. 
For participant selection, planning for more options in participant recruitment could be done, and/or improving testing structure and conditions.
