purpose of the assignment: 3-5 sentences what you want to show via this assignment.


Hawaii has a broad range of government websites for their divisions. The intent of each division's website is to provide informative content from which the website user can benefit. The user is typically a perspective visitor or perhaps a current/new resident of Hawaii. Beneficial information on each division may vary, but typically it should at least be updated for currently relevant usage, and user-friendly to obtain what content a user wants out of their usage. 

Some divisions of Hawaii's government contain more flaws than others. It is crucial to determine what flaws are present to improve usability. For this reason, I am going to evaluate usability conditions of two Hawaii website divisions: [Hawaii's Creative Industries](https://cid.hawaii.gov) and [Hawaii State Department of Health](https://health.hawaii.gov)
. I selected these two very different divisions because of my interest in those division topics and their presentation through their websites. By selecting two very different websites for heuristic evaluation, I was able to obtain broader context on their strengths and weaknesses. 

The heuristic evaluation performed allowed me to determine which website I am interested in improving: The Creative Industries website. Gathering usability problems among each website will serve as a foundation off of which I will present an improved website design of the Creative Industries division for the Hawaii website. 




# Website 1: [Hawaii's Creative Industries](https://cid.hawaii.gov)

The website for Hawaii's Creative Industries is simple and presents general information on the type of industries Hawaii has to offer. The main content provided are general news and organizational resources for the following creative industries: Applied Design, Film, Interactive Media, Literary Arts/Publishing, Performing Arts & Music, and Visual Arts. 

## Overall Impression:
This website has major flaws regarding those in itself. The simple presentation is not representative of the divisions creative industries. Also, the website is extremely limited in the information provided, lacking the ability to provide users with relevant updated news and content that actually serves the typical type of user's needs. Users of this website are inferred to be creatives that are interested in useful resources and activities in Hawaii, and the website should be designed as such. Instead, the website contains generic information, lacks relevant activity searches, updated information, and detailed resources.
